Emacs >= 25.1, Clojure >= 1.8.0

Pick your definition:
- UNREPL.el is a Clojure IDE for Emacs.
- UNREPL.el is a client interface to a Clojure's Socket REPL through the [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl][UNREPL]]
  protocol.

* Introduction
  Both definitions above are correct and complement each other.

  UNREPL.el started as a simple experiment for using the [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl][UNREPL]] protocol as the
  communication method between an Emacs buffers and a Clojure Socket REPL.  With
  the pass of time, it has been evolving into an alternative* Clojure IDE.
  Currently it has a fair amount of [[#features][Features]].

  UNREPL.el is meant to be REPL-centric.  That means that UI relies heavily on
  the REPL for displaying any kind of data that may be too big or complex to
  display in the Echo Area or as an overlay.

  \* UNREPL.el is an "alternative" because it is of the same nature as [[https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][CIDER]],
  but both differ in certain UI decisions, included the aforementioned.  That
  said, UREPL.el also takes a lot of inspiration from CIDER's features.  If you
  are new to Clojure development in Emacs, for now I would recommend to start
  with CIDER, since it's more stable, more & better documented, and has a bigger
  community behind it.

* Features

*** Automatically create a Socket REPL using your project's build tool
    UNREPL.el currently supports [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] or [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]] >= 2.7.2.

*** Connect to an existing Socket REPL

    [[file:gifs/connect-to.gif]]

*** Elided data structures
    Taking advantage of one of UNREPL's nice features, the REPL buffer will
    elide big or complex data structures with clickable buttons.

*** Playing with Images? why not opening them in the REPL?
    UNREPL.el supports displaying buffered images directly in the REPL.

    [[file:gifs/hendrix.gif]]

*** Standard output strings can be grouped into their respective REPL entries
    This is a customizable feature, you can turn it off by setting
    =unrepl-repl-group-stdout= to =nil=.

    #+caption: Grouped stdout strings
    [[file:gifs/grouped-outs.gif]]

*** In place documentation
    A la [[https://github.com/unrepl/unravel][Unravel]].  Hit =C-c C-d= to get in-place documentation of the symbol at
    point.

    #+caption: In place documentation
    [[file:gifs/in-place-doc.gif]]

*** Pretty (and elided) stacktraces

    #+caption: Elided stacktraces
    [[file:gifs/exceptions.gif]]

*** Even for lazy errors
    Lazy errors are reduced to a minimum expression, with a button to inspect
    further.

    #+caption: Lazy errors
    [[file:gifs/lazy-errors.gif]]

*** Interactive evaluation results overlays
    Same as [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/][CIDER]] and [[http://lighttable.com/][LightTable]].

    #+caption: Interactive evaluation overlays
    [[file:gifs/overlays.gif]]

*** Is the result too big? Inspect it in the REPL
    When interactive results are too big for in-buffer overlays, you can just
    move them to the REPL buffer and inspect them there.

    UNREPL.el will also copy/paste the evaluated expression and add it to the
    REPL history.

    #+caption: Interactive inspection
    [[file:gifs/interactive-inspection.gif]]

*** Interactive Exception happened? Inspect it in the REPL
    Exceptions are shown in the REPL buffer, no matter where they come from.
    UNREPL.el will try to figure out which expression caused the exception and
    will copy it to the REPL buffer as well.

    #+caption: Interactive exception
    [[file:gifs/interactive-exception.gif]]

*** And there is more to come...
    Before releasing the first UNREPL.el stable version, a couple more features
    might land in:
    - REPL pretty printing for evaluation results.
    - Visible UI for interrupting pending evaluations.
    - Key bindings to navigate buttons in the REPL.

* (not so) Quick Start

** Installing
   As of right now, UNREPL.el is not in [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/][MELPA]] yet, so in order to install it,
   you might need to get your hands a bit dirty:

   1. Install [[https://github.com/plexus/a.el][a.el]], [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode][clojure-mode]], [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]], and [[https://github.com/volrath/treepy.el][treepy]].  All available in [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/][MELPA]].

   2. Download this repository, or clone it with its submodules:

      #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl.el
      #+END_SRC

   3. Then place this repository, and its *parseclj* submodule copy, somewhere
      in your load-path.  Or just paste this in your emacs configuration and
      evaluate it:

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (let ((unrepl-dir "/path/to/your/copy/of/unrepl.el"))
        (add-to-list 'load-path unrepl-dir)
        (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "parseclj" unrepl-dir))
        (require 'unrepl))
      #+END_SRC

** Connecting to a Socket REPL
   The main way to connect to a Socket REPL in UNREPL.EL is by issuing:
   =M-x unrepl-connect=.

   When this command is executed in a buffer that belongs to a Clojure project,
   it will automagically create a Socket REPL for it and connect.  Right now,
   UNREPL.el supports only automatic connection in projects using [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] or
   [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]] >= 2.7.2.

   If you already have a Socket REPL running, you can prefix the connect command
   (=C-u M-x unrepl-connect=) or issue =M-x unrepl-connect-to= to get a prompt
   for inserting your Socket's host and port.

   There are several ways to create your own Socket REPL, here are some examples:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    # lein:
    $ JVM_OPTS='-Dclojure.server.myrepl={:port,5555,:accept,clojure.core.server/repl}' lein repl
    # or boot < 2.7.2:
    $ boot -i "(do (require 'clojure.core.server) (clojure.core.server/start-server {:port 5555 :name :repl :accept 'clojure.core.server/repl}))" wait
    # or boot >= 2.7.2:
    $ boot socket-server --port 5555 wait
    # or plain Clojure jar:
    $ java -Dclojure.server.myrepl="{:port 5555,:accept,clojure.core.server/repl}" -jar ~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/clojure-1.8.0.jar
    #+END_SRC

   After UNREPL.el successfully connects to a Socket REPL you will be greeted
   with a REPL Buffer, and all your Clojure buffers related to the project you
   just connected will have the =unrepl-mode= activated automatically.

** Usage
   Besides the REPL Buffer, UNREPL.el enables a few commands in each Clojure
   Buffer running =unrepl-mode=:

   - Autocompletion with [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]].
   - =C-c C-z=: Switch to REPL buffer
   - =C-x C-e=: Evaluate expression before point.
   - =C-c C-c=: Evaluate top level expression.
   - =C-c C-r=: Send last evaluation to the REPL buffer.
   - =C-c C-b=: Evaluate buffer.
   - =C-c C-g=: Interrupt current evaluation.
   - =C-c C-q=: Quit UNREPL.el
